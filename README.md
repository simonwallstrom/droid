# Droid - Just another Sublime text theme

Dark, Droid Sans Mono heavy theme that goes great with my favourite color scheme Tomorrow Night.

### Installation

1. `cd` to `~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages`
2. Clone this repo: `git clone git@github.com:simonwallstrom/droid.git`
3. Restart Sublime Text.

Activate the theme by opening Preferences.sublime-settings `âŒ˜ + ,` and add the following lines:
    
    "color_scheme": "Packages/droid/droid.tmTheme",
    "theme": "tomorrowNight.sublime-theme",

### Contribution

Heavily influenced and based on the awesome [Devastate theme](https://github.com/vlakarados/devastate)

### Notes

This theme is still very much in the making and will probably contain bugs. Use at your own risk.
